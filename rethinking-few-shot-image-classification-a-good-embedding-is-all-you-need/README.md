# Rethinking Few-Shot Image Classification: a Good Embedding Is All You Need?

Article: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11539.pdf

## Idea

Instead of use complex few-shot techniques learn embeddings on train tasks and
then simple linear model on this embeddings for test

## Results:

Sota on some datasets
